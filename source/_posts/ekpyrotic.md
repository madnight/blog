The standard cosmological model suggests that the universe began with a singular event known as the Big Bang. According to this view, space, time, and matter all originated from a single point of infinite density, expanding outward to form the universe we observe today.[^1] However, the ekpyrotic universe model provides an alternative explanation, suggesting that the universe did not originate from a singularity but rather from a slow, contracting phase followed by a transition into expansion.[^2]

This model is based on ideas from string theory and brane cosmology, which propose that our universe may be a three-dimensional structure (a "brane") existing within a higher-dimensional space. The key feature of the ekpyrotic model is the idea that our universe was shaped by a collision between branes in this extra-dimensional space.[^3]

To understand this concept, it is helpful to think about the idea of extra dimensions. In string theory, space is not just the three dimensions we experience, but may also include additional dimensions that are not directly observable. Within this framework, our universe can be thought of as a three-dimensional surface, a "brane", embedded in a higher-dimensional space.[^4]

Now, imagine that there is another brane, similar to our own, existing parallel to it. These branes are usually separate, but under certain conditions, they may move toward each other and eventually collide. According to the ekpyrotic model, this collision generates the conditions necessary for the universe to transition into an expanding phase, similar to what we describe as the Big Bang.[^2][^5]

This process differs significantly from the standard Big Bang model because it does not require a singularity. Instead of everything originating from a single point of infinite density, the universe undergoes a slow contraction before the branes collide. This allows the universe to be much older than what is typically assumed in Big Bang cosmology, potentially extending infinitely into the past through repeated cycles.[^6]


### What Are Branes in String Theory?

Brane cosmology is an extension of string theory that proposes our universe exists as a three-dimensional membrane (or "brane") embedded within a higher-dimensional space. This idea originates from M-theory, an extension of string theory that unifies different versions of the theory into a single framework, suggesting that fundamental objects in the universe are not just strings but also higher-dimensional membranes (branes).[^7] In this framework, our familiar three-dimensional universe is thought to be a 3-brane existing within a larger-dimensional bulk space. While these extra dimensions are not directly perceptible in our everyday experience, they provide a structural background in which the universe evolves.

In string theory, the fundamental entities of nature are not point-like particles but vibrating strings. These strings can be either open or closed: open strings have endpoints that must be attached to a surface, known as a brane, whereas closed strings form loops and can move freely through the surrounding higher-dimensional space, called the bulk.[^8] Branes, which exist in various dimensions depending on the model, serve as the foundation for the brane-world hypothesis, in which our observable universe is confined to a 3-brane within a higher-dimensional space.

A crucial implication of this model is that all known fundamental particles that make up matter—such as quarks, electrons, and neutrinos—are confined to our 3-brane, as are the fundamental forces described by the Standard Model of physics, including electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force.[^4] These forces do not propagate into extra dimensions, meaning that interactions involving light and matter remain restricted to the brane. However, gravity behaves differently. Since gravity is mediated by gravitons, which are associated with closed strings, it is not confined to the brane and can instead move freely through the bulk.[^9] This property offers a potential explanation for why gravity appears significantly weaker than the other fundamental forces—some of its influence may be leaking into extra dimensions rather than being fully concentrated on our 3-brane.

A key consequence of this framework is that we do not have direct access to extra dimensions except through gravitational interactions or potentially other exotic effects. If another 3-brane existed parallel to ours within the bulk, we would not be able to see it or interact with it using electromagnetic or nuclear forces, since those forces are confined to their respective branes. However, gravity, which can travel between branes, could still exert an influence, leading to gravitational interactions between parallel branes.[^10] This concept plays a crucial role in the ekpyrotic scenario, an alternative cosmological model in which the motion and eventual collision of two parallel branes provide an explanation for the Big Bang. Instead of originating from a singularity, as in the standard cosmological model, the universe in the ekpyrotic scenario emerges from a pre-existing structure in extra dimensions, where cycles of brane collisions could be responsible for cosmic evolution. If correct, this model suggests that the universe undergoes periodic contractions and expansions due to repeated brane interactions, offering an alternative to the traditional inflationary model of cosmology.[^5][^6]

### How Do Branes Move and Collide?

A useful way to visualize this is to imagine two vast, flat sheets floating within a higher-dimensional space. These sheets, representing the branes, remain parallel yet are influenced by forces that cause them to move closer over time. The bulk energy affects their motion, and eventually, the branes collide. This collision releases a massive amount of energy at the point of impact, causing the branes to rebound and move apart again.[^11] In the ekpyrotic model, this event replaces the singularity of the traditional Big Bang, serving as a transition between two phases: first, a slow contracting phase as the branes approach each other, followed by a sudden release of energy upon collision, which we perceive as the Big Bang, and then the expansion of the universe as the branes move apart once more.

One of the most intriguing implications of this model is that time may not have a true beginning. Instead, the universe could have undergone multiple cycles of brane collisions, with each collision resetting the expansion of space.[^12] This cyclic nature eliminates the need for an initial singularity and suggests that the universe has existed through an eternal series of contractions and expansions.

The movement of branes is not arbitrary but governed by forces within the bulk space. Several factors contribute to their approach and eventual collision. One of the primary influences is gravity, which, unlike other forces that are constrained to branes, can move freely through the extra dimensions. This allows branes to attract each other gravitationally.[^10] Another crucial force comes from scalar fields, particularly the moduli field, which dictates the separation between branes. Acting like a form of cosmic tension, this field pulls the branes together over time. Additionally, quantum effects introduce fluctuations in the brane structure, subtly influencing their motion.

As the branes draw closer, their interaction intensifies, causing the space between them to shrink. When they finally collide, the energy stored in their separation is released, filling the universe with radiation and matter. This perspective fundamentally differs from the classical Big Bang model, where the universe is thought to originate from an unexplained singularity. Instead, in the ekpyrotic model, the "Bang" is a natural consequence of the dynamics of branes moving through extra dimensions.[^2][^5]

### How This Model Addresses Cosmological Problems

The ekpyrotic model provides possible solutions to several challenges in standard cosmology:

* The Initial Singularity Problem – In the standard Big Bang model, physics breaks down at the singularity, meaning there is no clear explanation for how the universe began. The ekpyrotic model replaces this singularity with a slow contraction phase, removing the need for an initial infinite density point.[^2]

* The Horizon Problem – The cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation is remarkably uniform across the sky, even though different regions of the universe should not have had time to interact. In standard cosmology, this is resolved using inflation, a rapid expansion phase. The ekpyrotic model provides an alternative by allowing information to spread during the slow contraction phase, naturally leading to uniformity.[^6]

* The Flatness Problem – The universe appears to be very close to geometrically flat. Standard cosmology explains this by proposing inflation, which stretches the geometry of space-time. The ekpyrotic model achieves a similar result through the contraction phase, which smooths out any irregularities before the expansion begins.

* The Origin of Cosmic Structures – The universe contains regions of higher and lower density, which later formed galaxies and other structures. These variations are thought to come from tiny quantum fluctuations. In standard cosmology, inflation stretches these fluctuations to macroscopic scales. In the ekpyrotic model, fluctuations arise during contraction and are preserved through the brane collision.


### Conclusion

The ekpyrotic universe model offers a different perspective on cosmic origins by replacing the Big Bang singularity with a collision between extra-dimensional branes. In this view, the universe is a three-dimensional membrane moving through a higher-dimensional space, periodically undergoing cycles of contraction, collision, and expansion.

While this model has yet to be confirmed, it provides a possible answer to the question of what came before the Big Bang—suggesting that time and space may have existed forever, shaped by interactions in dimensions beyond our perception.

Further research, especially in gravitational wave detection and high-energy physics, may provide new insights into whether brane collisions played a role in the formation of our universe.
