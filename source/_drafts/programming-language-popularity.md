There are many programming language popularity rankings out the in the internet. 

One of the popular ones is the TOIBE index, that is based TODO describe on what its based

Its not easy to choose a objective indicator for such rankings, but by mixing things together with different percentage weights it seems arbitrary metric

For this very reason i decided to create a page that is not based on multiple indactors and weights, instead it is based on raw data from one source, with one metric.

It might be hard or even impossible to find a data source that a approximates the entire programming community, becuase many projects are closed source and the type of language that is used is unkown. And even in the case the the programmming language is known


Another consideration that might come into mind is that, for instance the Microsoft Kernel is written in C++,
it is not said that the developers are happy with that language, should a popularity index somehow respect that the developers are freee to choose the language and are not forced to do so? On the other hand there are devsloper surveys on published on the stackoverlflw blog where prpgramming language that are not largley used such as haskell, seems to have many developer fans and thats whats they write in on their weekends...

So you have to chose publicty  avaikable 
so that anyone is able to check the results

The idea to create a analysis of popularity from programming languages that are used on github is not new. The github projecr githut provided ... such a thing
unfortunaltey the dataset havve not been updated since 2015. Issues have been raised, in where the project creator have been asked what has happend to the poject. His answer was, that Github changed their BigQuery dataset, making it impossible to fetch the required information to proceed the project.

The ranking is intented to not make the impression that any of the listed language is better than any other language as a result of an complicated calculation, it is better to be understood as a sorted list based on a critera. The criteras are given by the dataset itself, they are simply the type of events that got tracked.

it simply provides a metric on how many issues
