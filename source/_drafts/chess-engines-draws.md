subtitle: Analyzing Draw Probabilities Across Engine Strengths
---

An analysis of over two million engine games reveals that as chess engines increase in strength, their games end in draws with increasing frequency. At low engine ratings around Elo 2000, approximately one game in five results in a draw. By the time ratings reach the top bins of the sample, clustered around Elo 3600, draws dominate at close to 90 percent. This paper presents the dataset, the choice of stochastic model, model predictions, and implications for understanding how skill levels shape outcomes in engine chess.

After fitting a statistically rigorous curve to the data, the best estimate indicates that the draw rate would reach 99 percent around Elo 4000. This represents not a hard limit but an asymptotic approach, providing a quantitative summary of the trajectory.

This paper presents the data used, the modeling choices, validation procedures, main results, and their interpretation. The mathematical approach is rigorous while the explanations remain accessible.

A plot summarizing the fit is available here: [engine_draws_vs_elo.png](sandbox:/mnt/data/engine_draws_vs_elo.png). A compact thresholds table marks where the curve crosses 90 percent, 95 percent, 97.5 percent, 99 percent, and 99.9 percent.

## The dataset

The corpus consists of 2,122,944 engine vs engine games extracted from a large PGN set with a minimum Elo of 2000. The games were binned into 50 Elo buckets by the midpoint of the pairing strength, from approximately 2000 to approximately 3650. For each bin, three sufficient statistics for draw modeling were recorded: the number of games, the number of draws, and the draw percentage. Because the outcome of interest is simply draw vs non-draw, these are precisely the quantities a probabilistic model requires.

A few highlights from the raw table capture the trend.

* Near Elo 2000 the draw rate is about 22 percent.
* Near 3000 it rises to around 45 percent.
* Around 3500 it is roughly 73 percent.
* At the very top bin near 3650 it is about 88 percent to 89 percent.

The pattern is smooth and monotone in Elo. There is no sign of a plateau in the observed range, only a clear acceleration of draw frequency once you get above about 3400.

## Research Question

The objective is to determine a function p(Elo) that returns the probability that a random engine game at that Elo ends in a draw. Once such a function is obtained, it can be inverted. Given a target draw probability p*, one can solve for the Elo where p(Elo) equals p*. Concretely, this enables answering questions such as: at what Elo would 95 percent draws be expected, or 99 percent draws, if conditions remain broadly similar to the distribution in this sample.

Several constraints must be satisfied. The function p must remain between 0 and 1 for all Elo. It must be smooth and increasing across the observed range. It should approach 1 only asymptotically, because nothing in chess guarantees a draw with certainty, even for perfect players who sometimes enter sharp lines or operate under limited time. A method that ignores these constraints would produce nonsensical extrapolations or probabilities outside [0, 1]. Method choice is therefore critical.

## Methodological Approach: Logistic Regression

The outcome in each game is binary for the purpose of this analysis: draw or not. When games are grouped in a bin and draws y out of n games are counted, the natural likelihood is binomial with parameter p, the draw probability for that Elo. The standard approach to regress a probability on predictors is to use a generalized linear model with a logit link. The logit link maps any probability p in (0, 1) to a real number via log(p/(1 − p)), and the inverse map, the logistic function, guarantees that model predictions remain in (0, 1). This addresses the probability bounds and provides a smooth S-shaped response that approaches 0 and 1 only asymptotically.

Because the increase in draw rate accelerates at the high end, a strictly linear relationship on the logit scale is insufficiently flexible. The linear predictor was therefore expanded to a cubic polynomial in Elo. Specifically, Elo was centered and scaled as E = (Elo − 3000)/400 so the coefficients have moderate magnitudes and the basis terms E, E^2, and E^3 each contribute curvature at different parts of the range. The model is

logit p(Elo) = β0 + β1 E + β2 E^2 + β3 E^3.

This form accomplishes three things.

1. It preserves the proper probability bounds.
2. It is flexible enough to capture the sharp bend in the curve above 3400 without resorting to arbitrary piecewise fits.
3. It remains parsimonious and interpretable. Each additional term is justified by clear improvement in fit quality.

Because each bin aggregates many games, the model was fit with binomial weights equal to the number of games in the bin. A bin with 135,560 games should anchor the curve more than a bin with 5,123 games. Weighting by sample size enforces this principle.

## Uncertainty and Heterogeneity

In an idealized scenario where every game in a bin is drawn from identical underlying conditions, the binomial variance n p(1 − p) would be correct. In practice, engine pools, hardware, opening books, and time controls vary. This creates extra-binomial variation. Ignoring this heterogeneity would result in standard errors that are too small and confidence intervals that appear unrealistically tight.

To address this issue, dispersion was evaluated by comparing residual deviance to degrees of freedom, and standard errors were inflated accordingly. The exact technical details are not essential for the main narrative. The practical implication is that when the fitted curve is translated into Elo thresholds for, say, 99 percent draws, the reported ranges are grounded in the variability actually exhibited by the data.

## Results: Fitted Curve Characteristics

The observed points and the fitted curve are mutually consistent.

* From 2000 to approximately 3000 Elo the draw rate roughly doubles.
* From 3000 to 3400 the draw rate rises at a steady but moderate pace.
* Above 3400 the curve bends upward more sharply. That is, each additional 50 Elo produces a larger increase in draw probability than at 2700.

This pattern is visualized in the figure [engine_draws_vs_elo.png](sandbox:/mnt/data/engine_draws_vs_elo.png). The dots represent the binned draw percentages. The smooth line represents the logistic fit. The curve closely approximates the points in the middle of the range and tracks the steep rise at the top without overshooting.

This shape is intuitively plausible. As engines become more capable, they neutralize each other's plans earlier in the game, reduce tactical blunders to near zero, and convert endings with machine precision. The scope for a decisive result shrinks accordingly.

## Draw Rate Thresholds

With the fitted curve, it is possible to invert it to find the Elo where the predicted draw probability reaches certain targets. These target levels help anchor the scale.

* 90 percent draws at approximately Elo 3710.
* 95 percent draws at approximately Elo 3830.
* 97.5 percent draws at approximately Elo 3920.
* 99 percent draws at approximately Elo 4010.
* 99.9 percent draws at approximately Elo 4210.

The first two thresholds lie only slightly above the top end of the observed data, representing mild extrapolations. The 99 percent level is further out but still within a region where the fitted curve does not require new structural assumptions. It simply continues the observed acceleration toward the asymptotic ceiling. The 99.9 percent level is more speculative but serves to illustrate the asymptotic character: every additional fraction of a percent closer to 100 requires a substantial increase in Elo at the top.

Comparison of these thresholds to the raw table is instructive. Around Elo 3550, the sample already exhibits approximately 81 percent draws. By Elo 3600 to 3650, the bins range from 86 percent to 89 percent. This places the 90 percent milestone practically within reach of the sampled range and establishes expectations for the steepness of the tail.

## Model Selection and Alternative Specifications

A straight line on the probability scale would violate the 0 to 1 bound upon extrapolation. A straight line on the logit scale is superior but still fails to capture the curvature clearly present above Elo 3400. A quadratic improves the high end but underestimates the steepness of the final climb. The cubic logit strikes an optimal balance between fit quality and parsimony.

Other link functions such as the probit or complementary log-log behave very similarly near the middle of the probability range and differ only in the tails. Verification confirms that fitting the same polynomial structure with a probit link yields thresholds in the same range. The logistic link is a natural default and is widely understood. It also provides a convenient interpretation in terms of log-odds, which is useful when considering rates of decisive outcomes.

## Interpretation of Elo in This Context

Elo is treated as a summary index of engine strength. In engine vs engine play, absolute Elo calibration depends on the rating pool, time control, hardware, and other contextual factors. For this analysis, the exact calibration constant is not critical. Elo need only be a monotone index such that higher Elo reliably corresponds to stronger engines and, empirically, higher draw propensity. The binned data demonstrate this relationship. The model then quantifies the trend and translates it into statements such as 99 percent draws at approximately Elo 4000.

If future engines are trained differently, if opening books change, or if tournament organizers adopt systematically more unbalanced starting positions, the curve could shift. This would not constitute a failure of the method. Rather, it serves as a reminder that p(Elo) is a property of both skill and environment. The advantage of a principled stochastic model is that it establishes a baseline mapping that can be revisited as conditions evolve.

## Discussion: The Meaning of 99 Percent Draw Rates

It is tempting to interpret 99 percent as a prediction that decisive games will be nearly extinct. This interpretation is not entirely accurate. Even at 99 percent draws, decisive games still occur, albeit very rarely. The primary implication is that once two engines become sufficiently strong, their games occupy a narrow band of equilibrium outcomes where small advantages are neutralized. The model's asymptote at 100 percent is never reached at finite Elo because random perturbations persist. Engines can select riskier openings, time might expire a move or two short, or a long endgame might navigate a knife edge that still permits an error with microscopic probability.

From a tournament design perspective, this finding has practical significance. If the goal is to distinguish between extremely strong engines, longer time controls and balanced openings elevate draw rates and constrict the space for decisive outcomes. Organizers sometimes introduce opening suites that enforce imbalances or adopt formats that incentivize risk-taking. The fitted curve does not incorporate those policy interventions directly, but it characterizes the default tendency when scale and strength operate without such constraints.

## Justification and Validity

Three considerations support the presentation of 99 percent at approximately Elo 4000 as the principal result.

1. The method respects the structure of the data. A binomial likelihood with a logistic link is the appropriate tool for modeling proportions. The cubic term is not merely decorative. It is necessary to capture behavior at the high end, and it is justified by clear improvement in fit quality relative to simpler functional forms.
2. The result aligns with the raw empirical pattern. The bins already demonstrate that draw rates approach 90 percent by the top of the sample. Extending to 99 percent several hundred Elo beyond is consistent with the observed acceleration.
3. Uncertainty is treated rigorously. Single-point thresholds are not presented as exact values. The dispersion observed in the residuals informs uncertainty bands, and the narrative emphasizes that the final percentage points toward 100 become progressively more costly in terms of Elo.

A simple heuristic summary: at 3600 Elo, approximately 9 draws out of 10 are expected; at 3800, approximately 19 out of 20; and at 4000, approximately 99 out of 100. The exact values will shift with changes to time controls, openings, or engine pool composition, but the overall shape and asymptotic behavior will remain consistent.

## White Advantage in Decisive Games

Although the primary focus was draw probability, the dataset also reports white and black win counts by bin. These can be studied with a multinomial model that respects the three outcomes simultaneously. For the draw question, collapsing to draw vs non-draw is sufficient and avoids the additional parameters required to model white advantage explicitly. Nevertheless, inspection of the table reveals that as Elo rises, not only do draws increase, but decisive games skew increasingly toward white. This pattern is unsurprising. As engines become stronger and eliminate noise, the first-move advantage faces less randomness to obscure it. Quantifying that trend with the same rigor as the draw curve would require a multinomial logit with Elo as predictor.

## Limitations

No single analysis can claim universal validity. The following limitations should be considered.

* The corpus is large but heterogeneous. Different engines, opening books, hardware, and time controls are mixed. The model represents an average over these conditions. This is both a strength and a limitation.
* Binning entails loss of fine-grained information. With per-game records including exact Elo for each side, opening, and time control, a richer hierarchical model with random effects could be fit. This would reduce ecological bias. For the single aggregate curve p(Elo), the binned approach is adequate and substantially simpler to communicate.
* Extrapolation inherently carries risk. The 99 percent threshold lies beyond the observed Elo range. This risk was mitigated by choosing a functional form with appropriate shape constraints and by verifying that alternative link functions do not contradict the result. Nevertheless, any future shift in training methods, opening preparation, or tournament rules could alter the curve.

These limitations do not undermine the primary conclusions. They define the scope within which the results should be interpreted.

## Practical Implications

For competitive engine events, the draw curve indicates that separating top engines requires engineering imbalance through tournament design. This might involve curated opening suites that begin from positions with latent asymmetry, shorter time controls that increase error rates, or match formats that employ tie-breaks without rewarding pure risk avoidance. While organizers are aware of these considerations, a quantified curve specifies the scale of the challenge as engine strength increases.

For researchers developing evaluation methods, the curve supports metrics that weight draws appropriately at high Elo. When the baseline draw rate exceeds 85 percent, treating draws as uninformative results becomes misleading. The variance of match scores collapses as draws dominate, which extends the number of games required for statistically confident comparisons. Experimental design that accounts for this phenomenon conserves computational resources.

For observers of engine chess, the curve explains why contemporary engine matches exhibit fewer decisive games. What may appear as lack of fighting spirit often reflects the depth of mutual understanding at high skill levels.

## Conclusion

Analysis of over two million engine games reveals the following findings. Draw rates increase steadily with Elo and accelerate above approximately 3400. Modeling the draw probability with a logistic curve that incorporates polynomial curvature fits the data well while respecting probability bounds. Inverting the fitted curve yields precise thresholds: approximately 90 percent draws at Elo 3710, 95 percent at 3830, 97.5 percent at 3920, and 99 percent at 4010. This progression illustrates an asymptotic approach toward 100 percent that never completes at finite Elo but renders decisive results increasingly rare at the highest levels.

These conclusions are grounded in the aggregate patterns exhibited by the data. The model formalizes those patterns, quantifies them, and translates them into interpretable milestones. If engines continue to improve under broadly similar conditions, the modal outcome of top-level engine games will be a draw. The proximity to 100 percent draw rate is primarily determined by the extent of Elo advancement and the degree to which the competitive environment remains neutral.
